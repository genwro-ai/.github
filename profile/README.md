Through constant innovation and continuous pursuit of excellence, we strive to redefine the boundaries of what is possible in the world of artificial intelligence. Our pioneering research drives the development of cutting-edge algorithms and techniques, enabling the creation of more reliable and intelligent machine learning systems. We consistently contribute research showcased at premier AI conferences like NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, ICLR.

We cooperate with various research centers, including University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, Tooploox, Warsaw University of Technology, ETH Zurich, UCD Dublin, GMUM, Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w.

Our areas of focus include:
- Generative models, 
- 3D representation learning, 
- Few-shot learning, 
- Uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution detection, 
- Computer vision (segmentation, image restoration, image and video generation),
- AI in biochemistry.
